## üö® Cyberbullying Detection System using NLP
## üìå Project Description

This project is a Cyberbullying Detection System built with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning.
It classifies tweets into categories such as:

age

gender

ethnicity

religion

other_cyberbullying

not_cyberbullying

The model was trained on the [Cyberbullying Classification Dataset Kaggle](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fandrewmvd%2Fcyberbullying-classification%3Fresource%3Ddownload) and deployed using Flask for real-time predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

Preprocessing: lowercasing, stopword removal, punctuation stripping, URL & mention removal

Text vectorization with TF-IDF

Deep Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow) with dropout & batch normalization

Handles class imbalance with class weighting

Real-time text prediction via Flask web app


## üìä Model Performance

Accuracy: 81%

Precision: 81%

Recall: 81%

F1 Score: 81%


## üîÆ Future Improvements

Upgrade to BERT/RoBERTa transformer models for better performance

Expand dataset to include more languages & platforms

Add API endpoints for integration with apps/social media

Deploy with Streamlit/Heroku/Docker for wider usability
